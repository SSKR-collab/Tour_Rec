## Proposal

### Dummy Customer (C):
This dummy customer is an enthusiastic traveler and often prepares trips for her and her friends. Ms. Sharma would want a web-based system wherein she could discover tourist destinations, engage with personalized recommendations, and efficiently plan and organize her travel itineraries.

### Problem Description
Planning a tour or voyage, especially in places one has never been to before, is often a complicated and taxing process. Travelers must gather information about various places, browse through options, optimize their routes, and juggle plans concerning their personal preferences and constraints. With an avalanche of information thrown online, it becomes almost impossible to distinguish between the top most tourist-installations and the most witty way to see them. Manual planning will most likely lead to less-than-ideal experiences, missing attractions, and more time wasted. 

In addition, the travelers want the watches to recommend and interlink the best digital tools that ease their journey. In the absence of such an integrated system, the user has to make all the considered guesses, and without good luck, they end up having less fun and less efficient trips.

## System Description
The Tour Recommendation System is a full-stack web application meant to ease and make travel planning more interesting. The system allows users to sign up, put their preferences in travel, and search and filter destinations on which recommendations are to be provided. Further, the system will allow an optimized tour plan to be generated. Integration with Google Maps and Places APIs provides real-time information, interactive maps, route optimization, and further services, all tailored to the needs of the user.

The system supports:
- User registration and authentication (including Google login)
- Profile and preference management
- Place discovery and search with detailed information
- Personalized recommendations based on user preferences and visit history
- Tour planning with route optimization (using Google Directions API and fallback algorithms)
- Saving, viewing, updating, and deleting tour plans
- Interactive maps and a dashboard with basic travel stats

## Key Features of the Tour Recommendation System
- **User Registration & Login:** Secure authentication via email/password or Google account.
- **Profile & Preferences:** Users can set and update their travel interests and preferences.
- **Place Discovery:** Search and filter destinations by type, location, and other criteria.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Receive suggestions for places to visit based on preferences and past activity.
- **Tour Planning & Route Optimization:** Create and optimize travel itineraries with multiple destinations, leveraging Google Maps and Directions APIs.
- **Interactive Maps:** Visualize destinations and routes on interactive maps.
- **Plan Management:** Save, view, update, and delete travel plans.
- **Dashboard:** View basic statistics such as saved tours and recent activities.

## Justification
Due to its application and scope, this project caters to a small team of web developers and presents a practical resolution to a common geographic and travel-related problem. It inculcates in the developer candidates all the necessary issues related to user authentication, data management, integration with third-party APIs, and interface design simplicity to the user. Being moderately challenging, the project embraces full-stack web development knowledge with external API usage; however, it should easily be finished within a semester if well modularized with a stepwise approach.
